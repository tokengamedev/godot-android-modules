# Godot Android Modules

Godot android modules is a free and open source collection of android plugins for Godot Game engine. 
It is the list of all commonly used plugins like billing, notifications and others.

The goals of the repository are:
1. Create a list of commonly used plugins in one place.
2. Ability to pick and choose from the plugins. (Less unwanted code / plugins)
3. Use latest APIs as much as possible
4. Automate script(v2) file generation. To check for (v1) check out the v1 branch


> :zap: **Important GAML Update:**
> 
> 1. All the plugins related to Advertisement display has been deprecated.  It includes ApplovinMax and Ogury Consent Manager.
>  The reason being the complexity of the advertisement media networks and multitude of SDKs. This requires a separate approach and hence a separate plugin/repo altogether
> 2. GAML has been split into two branches **v1** - for older V1 plugin architecture and **main** for V2  Plugin architecture
> 3. The versions have changed again due to plugin versions. Going forward for v1 plugins it will be 1.\*.* and v2 plugins it will be 2.\*.*. Also all plugins will have same version


### ‚öôÔ∏èInstallation and usage
